### :heavy_check_mark: The problem it solves

>Say you have an application hosting provider, offering you a web app or two for free,
but doesn't offer you enough free storage.<br><br>
On the other hand, you have a free service which provides enough storage, but gives little or no features to your app.<br><br>
[storeless](https://github.com/roshnet/storeless) acts as the bridge between both ends of these services. It provides a perfect match by bringing both features of these "free" services at your disposal.
